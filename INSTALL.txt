This document explains how to build and install QWinFF.

QWinFF needs ffmpeg and ffprobe at runtime.

1) Generic Compilation and Installation on Unix-like Systems
2) Changing Installation Path
3) Build on Windows

------------------------------

1) Generic Compilation and Installation on Unix-like Systems

You need Qt 4.3 or greater to compile QWinFF.

Be sure you have installed the Qt4 development package. Its name maybe
libqt4-dev, qt4-devel or similar.

Decompress the source code; open a console and enter the directory.

Type "make".

If everything is ok, you may type "make install" to install it.
This will install QWinFF in /usr/local.

If "make" fails, it's probably because the Qt3 qmake is used instead of
the Qt4 one.
Try to type something like this (just examples):
make QMAKE=qmake-qt4
or
make QMAKE=/usr/share/qt4/bin/qmake

------------------------------

2) Changing Installation Path

By default, QWinFF will be installed to /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install QWinFF under /usr

Note that the PREFIX used by "make" and "make install" must be the same.

In addition, you must install ffmpeg and ffprobe in order to run QWinFF.
Some output formats may require additional packages to be installed.
For example, non-free media formats are not supported by default in
Debian and Ubuntu. Please search for information about how to enable
these features by keywords like "ffmpeg non-free" or "ffmpeg mp3".

------------------------------

3) Build on Windows

You must install Qt4 SDK to build QWinFF.

Extract the source code to a directory.

Enter Qt4 console from the start menu entry and cd to the directory containing
the extracted source code.

Type "windows_build.bat"

If the build was successful,  the output files will be copied to
windows_release\

Copy necessary Qt DLLs to windows_release\
If you are using mingw, the DLLs are QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll,
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll and mingwm10.dll, which can be found in
<QtSDK>\Desktop\Qt\4.x.x\mingw\bin.

Download the latest FFmpeg static builds and copy ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe
to windows_release\ffmpeg.

Now you can execute QWinFF by clicking on the executable file.
