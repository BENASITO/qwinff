QWinFF aims to be an intuitive yet useful media converting interface.
It features a rich set of presets that can help average users to convert
between media formats without having to manually input every parameter; while
advanced users can still adjust detailed output options to meet their needs.

For compiling and installing QWinFF, please refer to INSTALL.txt.
